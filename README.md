# Vending Machine
Vending Machine Controller circuit that accepts coins and products \nselection as input, and supplies equested product and cash balance.\n

Display cash balanceand product cost on a 4 digit 7 segment displays on the Basys3 FPGA board.\n

Implemented this sequential digital systems using FSM model because it\nmust remember how much money has been inserted (keep track of states)\n

The vending machine controller currently has a coin-in mechanism that \ncan accept nickels, dimes, and quarters.\n
Assume that a pulse is generated when a coin is entered. Buttons were \nused to imulate coins being inserted\n
Switches were used as inputs for product selection.
